## Description

Enhanced Composites carbon fibre roll wrap tube uses high strength unidirectional carbon fibre running length-ways down the tube for stiffness and at 90° around the tube to provide hoop strength and resilience to crush, burst and torsional loads. In addition to this high strength uni core, our tubes are finished with a classic final layer of 2×2 twill weave carbon fibre and UV-stable clear high-gloss finish. The end result is a carbon fibre tube ideally suited for use in applications where it will be seen.

The tube has an outer diameter (OD) of 60 mm and an inner diameter (ID) of 56 mm.
How to Cut and Shape

They can be cut with a fine band saw, hacksaw, or dremel tool. Enhanced Composites roll wrap carbon fibre tubes are manufactured using an epoxy matrix; therefore they will easily bond with other epoxy resins.
Typical Uses

Roll-wrapped tubes are better for applications where the tube may be subject to a variety of forces including bend, twist and crush. These light 10 mm tubes are suitable for demanding engineering applications including scale aircraft, gliders, helicopter U.A.V.’s, lightweight frames or structures, tubular vessels, poles, column supports or any construction that requires strength, rigidity and lightness yet appearance is also important. They are equally suited to other precision applications like robotics and automation.

Tubes made with epoxy resin systems have virtually zero water absorption, making them suitable for marine-based use than lower-quality tubing made with vinylester or polyester resin systems.
